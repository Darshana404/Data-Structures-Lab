A. Utilize C++ STL to solve the following (K5),
There are n block towers, numbered from 1 to n. The i-th tower consists of aᵢ blocks.
In one move, you can move one block from tower i to tower j, but only if aᵢ > aⱼ.
That move increases aⱼ by 1 and decreases aᵢ by 1.
You can perform as many moves as you would like (possibly zero).
What's the largest amount of blocks you can have on tower 1 after the moves?
